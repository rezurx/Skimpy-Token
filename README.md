# SKIMPY Token

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
This is an experimental project intended for education and personal development.  
SKIMPY Token (SKMP) is not promoted, marketed, or intended for public use — but it is deployed on a public blockchain and permissionless by nature.  
Use at your own risk. No roadmap, utility, or support is provided.

SKIMPY is a **sandbox token project** for exploring smart contract development, tokenomics experimentation, and decentralized identity mechanics. This is not a product or launchpad — it's a **public learning lab**.

---

## Project Purpose

**Skimpy Token (SKMP)** is a deliberately **minimal, test-only ERC-20 token** designed as a **pilot project** for practicing blockchain development workflows. The core experiment is to create and deploy a token as cheaply as possible, validating the entire workflow on a minimal budget.

### Primary Purpose
- **Learning and Testing**: Master the end-to-end process of deploying blockchain assets on a minimal budget (e.g., ~$0.40 in gas fees).
- **Alpha Test**: Serve as the foundation for future, more legitimate token projects.

### Technical Objectives
- Practice **Solidity + Hardhat workflows**.
- Test deployments on **Base Sepolia** (testnet) and **Base Mainnet**.
- Verify contracts on **Basescan**.
- Add token metadata (logo, symbol, website).
- Optionally create a tiny liquidity pool (~$1 on Aerodrome).

### Strategic Context
Skimpy is explicitly **not a product** but rather a **dry run** that will lay the groundwork for:
- Future serious token launches (RWA-backed, memecoins, governance assets).
- CI/CD token workflows and security checks.
- UX systems like airdrop scripts and LP reward mechanisms.
- Integration into a larger **AI-powered micro-business incubator**.

### Key Characteristics
- **Non-promoted**: No marketing or community building.
- **Test-only**: A pure technical exercise.
- **Minimal Cost**: Designed to prove deployment is possible on a shoestring budget.
- **Foundation Building**: Once this works end-to-end, the developer plans to "scale and launch serious tokens."

Essentially, Skimpy Token is a **proof-of-concept** to validate the technical infrastructure before deploying real projects with actual utility and community value.

## Token Design Notes

* **Network**: Ethereum-compatible (Hardhat)
* **Token Standard**: ERC-20
* **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000 SKIMPY
* **Symbol**: SKIMPY
* **Mint Function**: Owner-only (for testing)
* **Burn Function**: Public
* **Extras** (Planned):

  * Faucet logic
  * Burn vault integration
  * Tokenomics tuning (e.g., demurrage, decay)
  * Optional metadata fields

---

## Tokenomics: Demurrage (Token Decay)

SKIMPY tokens are designed with a **demurrage** mechanism, meaning their balance slowly decreases over time. This feature is implemented to:

* **Discourage Hoarding:** Incentivize active use and circulation of tokens rather than holding them passively.
* **Stimulate Activity:** Encourage participation within the ecosystem by creating a cost for inaction.
* **Experimentation:** Serve as a practical experiment in dynamic tokenomics, aligning with the project's goal as a "public learning lab."

The decay is applied "just-in-time" whenever a token balance is accessed (e.g., during transfers or when checking `balanceOf`). The current decay rate is set to approximately 20% annually.
