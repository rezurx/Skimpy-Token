## 📋 Completed Tasks

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Setup (2025-06-30)
- [x] **Git Repository Initialization**
  - Initialized local git repo with all project files
  - Created initial commit with complete project structure
  - Set up `main` branch (renamed from `master`)

- [x] **GitHub Integration**
  - Connected local repo to GitHub: https://github.com/rezurx/Skimpy-Token
  - Successfully pushed all code to remote repository
  - Repository is private as intended

- [x] **Discord Webhook Setup**
  - Created Discord webhook integration
  - Added webhook URL to `.env.example` template
  - Built `scripts/discord-notify.js` for programmatic notifications
  - Configured `.env` file with actual webhook URL
  - ✅ **Tested successfully** - Discord notifications working

### ✅ Phase 2: Automation (2025-06-30)
- [x] **Git Automation Script**
  - Created `scripts/git-commit.sh` - one-command git workflow
  - Script handles: staging → commit → push → Discord notify
  - Made executable with proper error handling
  - ✅ **Tested successfully** - Full workflow automation working

- [x] **GitHub Actions Setup**  
  - Created `.github/workflows/discord-notify.yml`
  - Auto-notifications for pushes and pull requests
  - Configured to use GitHub Secrets for webhook URL
  - Supports rich Discord messages with commit details and links

## 🔧 Current Automation Workflows

### Local Development Workflow
```bash
# Make changes to code
./scripts/git-commit.sh "Your commit message"
# ↳ Automatically: stages, commits, pushes, notifies Discord
```

### GitHub Actions (Auto-triggered)
- **On Push to `main`:** Sends detailed Discord notification with commit info
- **On Pull Request:** Sends PR notification to Discord
- Uses `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` secret (needs to be configured in GitHub repo settings)

## 📁 Key Files Added/Modified

### New Files Created
- `scripts/discord-notify.js` - Discord notification utility
- `scripts/git-commit.sh` - Automated git workflow script  
- `.github/workflows/discord-notify.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `PROGRESS.md` - This progress tracking file

### Modified Files
- `.env.example` - Added Discord webhook URL template
- `.env` - Configured with actual webhook URL (gitignored)

## 🎛️ Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables (`.env`)
```bash
# Discord Integration
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...

# Blockchain Development (for future use)
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your-alchemy-api-key-here
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
BASESCAN_API_KEY=your-basescan-api-key-here
```

### GitHub Secrets (for Actions)
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` - Same webhook URL for automated notifications

## 🔍 For Future AI/CLI Reference

### Current Workflow
1. Developer makes changes locally
2. Runs `./scripts/git-commit.sh "message"` 
3. Script automatically handles git operations + Discord notification
4. GitHub Actions trigger additional Discord alerts
5. All changes are tracked in git history

### Key Commands
```bash
# Quick commit and push
./scripts/git-commit.sh "Your commit message"

# Manual Discord notification  
node scripts/discord-notify.js "Custom message"

# Standard git operations still work
git status
git log --oneline
```

### Integration Points
- **Discord Channel:** Configured webhook for automated project updates
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/rezurx/Skimpy-Token (private)
- **Local Project:** `/home/resurx/blockchain-projects/skimpy-token/`
