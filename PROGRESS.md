  - Script handles: staging ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push ‚Üí Discord notify
  - Made executable with proper error handling
  - ‚úÖ **Tested successfully** - Full workflow automation working

- [x] **GitHub Actions Setup**  
  - Created `.github/workflows/discord-notify.yml`
  - Auto-notifications for pushes and pull requests
  - Configured to use GitHub Secrets for webhook URL
  - Supports rich Discord messages with commit details and links

## üîß Current Automation Workflows

### Local Development Workflow
```bash
# Make changes to code
./scripts/git-commit.sh "Your commit message"
# ‚Ü≥ Automatically: stages, commits, pushes, notifies Discord
```

### GitHub Actions (Auto-triggered)
- **On Push to `main`:** Sends detailed Discord notification with commit info
- **On Pull Request:** Sends PR notification to Discord
- Uses `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` secret (needs to be configured in GitHub repo settings)

## üîç For Future AI/CLI Reference

### Current Workflow
1. Developer makes changes locally
2. Runs `./scripts/git-commit.sh "message"` 
3. Script automatically handles git operations + Discord notification
4. GitHub Actions trigger additional Discord alerts
5. All changes are tracked in git history

### Key Commands
```bash
# Quick commit and push
./scripts/git-commit.sh "Your commit message"

# Manual Discord notification  
node scripts/discord-notify.js "Custom message"

# Standard git operations still work
git status
git log --oneline
```

### Integration Points
- **Discord Channel:** Configured webhook for automated project updates
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/rezurx/Skimpy-Token (private)
- **Local Project:** `/home/resurx/blockchain-projects/skimpy-token/`

**Note:** This progress file should be updated after major milestones or significant changes to the project workflow.
