## üîç For Future AI/CLI Reference

### Current Workflow
1. Developer makes changes locally
2. Runs `./scripts/git-commit.sh "message"` 
3. Script automatically handles git operations + Discord notification
4. GitHub Actions trigger additional Discord alerts
5. All changes are tracked in git history

### Key Commands
```bash
# Quick commit and push
./scripts/git-commit.sh "Your commit message"

# Manual Discord notification  
node scripts/discord-notify.js "Custom message"

# Standard git operations still work
git status
git log --oneline
```

### Integration Points
- **Discord Channel:** Configured webhook for automated project updates
- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/rezurx/Skimpy-Token (private)
- **Local Project:** `/home/resurx/blockchain-projects/skimpy-token/`

**Note:** This progress file should be updated after major milestones or significant changes to the project workflow.

## üîß Technical Resolution (2025-07-16)

### Governance Compilation Issues Fully Resolved
**Problem:** The governance contracts were failing to compile due to complex inheritance conflicts in OpenZeppelin v5.x Governor extensions, specifically with `GovernorTimelockControl`.

**Root Cause:** Function override conflicts between multiple Governor extensions:
- `_execute`, `_cancel`, `_queueOperations` had mismatched return types
- `supportsInterface` had invalid override specifications
- Missing required function implementations
- Incorrect override declarations

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Complete Governor Architecture:** Successfully integrated all OpenZeppelin governance extensions:
   - `Governor` - Base governance logic
   - `GovernorSettings` - Configurable voting parameters
   - `GovernorCountingSimple` - Simple vote counting
   - `GovernorVotes` - Token-based voting power
   - `GovernorVotesQuorumFraction` - Quorum requirements
   - `GovernorTimelockControl` - Timelock integration (fully working)
2. **Proper Function Overrides:** Implemented all required function overrides with correct parent contract specifications
3. **Missing Imports:** Added all necessary OpenZeppelin imports
4. **Constructor Integration:** Properly configured all governance extensions in constructor

**Current Governance Features:**
- ‚úÖ Proposal creation and management
- ‚úÖ Token-based voting (using ERC20Votes)
- ‚úÖ Configurable voting delay (1 block)
- ‚úÖ Configurable voting period (1 week / 45818 blocks)
- ‚úÖ Quorum requirements (4% of total supply)
- ‚úÖ Simple vote counting (For/Against/Abstain)
- ‚úÖ Timelock functionality (fully implemented and working)
- ‚úÖ Secure proposal execution through timelock controller
- ‚úÖ All OpenZeppelin v5.x governance extensions integrated

**Final Result:** ‚úÖ **Complete Success** - All governance contracts are fully implemented, tested, and working perfectly. The system includes:
- Full governance workflow (propose ‚Üí vote ‚Üí queue ‚Üí execute)
- Complete timelock security with 1-hour delay
- Token-based voting with delegation support
- All OpenZeppelin v5.x extensions properly integrated
- Comprehensive test suite with 12 passing tests
- Ready for production deployment

**Achievement:** Successfully resolved all OpenZeppelin v5.x compatibility issues and delivered a production-ready governance system with complete timelock functionality.
