# Disclaimer

This repository contains code and documentation for Skimpy Token (SKMP), a personal educational project.

SKMP is not an investment, product, or official launch. It is a deliberately non-promoted token deployed for the purpose of learning blockchain workflows and testing smart contract mechanics.

Although the contract is deployed on a public blockchain (Base), its presence is **not an invitation** to buy, sell, or speculate. Any interaction with the SKMP token is done **entirely at the user's own discretion and risk**.

No guarantees are made regarding functionality, future development, liquidity, or token value. This project carries no promise of support or maintenance.

Do not mistake this repository for a token offering, DAO launch, or crypto product.
