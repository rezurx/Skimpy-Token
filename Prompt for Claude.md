 Prompt for Claude

  "I'm working on a Hardhat project called 'Skimpy-Token'. I've recently implemented a demurrage (token decay) feature in contracts/Skimpy.sol. This feature
  causes token balances to slowly decrease over time.

  The core contract (Skimpy.sol) has been updated, but now my tests are failing because they don't correctly account for this time-based decay. I need your help
  to:

   1. Fix the failing tests in test/skimpy.test.js and test/integration.test.js to properly handle the demurrage.
   2. Update the project documentation to reflect the new demurrage feature and the current project status.

  Here's the current state of the project and the specific changes needed:

  ---

  Project Context:

   * Project Root: /home/resurx/blockchain-projects/skimpy-token/
   * Demurrage Implementation: contracts/Skimpy.sol now includes _applyDecay logic, which is triggered by _update (used by transfers, mints, burns). The balanceOf
     function also calculates the decayed balance.
   * Problem: Tests are failing because they expect exact balances or don't account for the decay that happens during test execution.

  Task 1: Fix Failing Tests

  You need to modify the following test files. The key is to use expect().to.be.closeTo() for balance comparisons where decay is a factor, and to fetch balances
  immediately before and immediately after the action being tested.

  File: `/home/resurx/blockchain-projects/skimpy-token/test/skimpy.test.js`

   * `describe("Transfers")` block:
       * `it("Should transfer tokens between accounts, applying decay")`:
           * Modify this test to get ownerBalanceBefore and addr1BalanceBefore right before the skimpy.transfer call.
           * Then, get ownerBalanceAfter and addr1BalanceAfter right after the transfer.
           * Assertions should use closeTo with a tolerance of ethers.parseEther("0.01").
           * Example: expect(addr1BalanceAfter).to.be.closeTo(addr1BalanceBefore + transferAmount, ethers.parseEther("0.01"));
       * `it("Should fail if sender doesn't have enough tokens")`:
           * This test's assertion expect(await skimpy.balanceOf(owner.address)).to.equal(initialOwnerBalance); is incorrect. Even a reverted transaction triggers
             decay on the owner's balance.
           * Change the assertion to: expect(await skimpy.balanceOf(owner.address)).to.be.lt(ownerBalanceBefore); (less than).

   * `describe("Burns")` block:
       * `it("Should transfer tokens to the burn vault, applying decay")`:
           * Similar to the transfer test, get ownerBalanceBefore, vaultBalanceBefore before the burn.
           * Get ownerBalanceAfter, vaultBalanceAfter after the burn.
           * Assertions should use closeTo with a tolerance of ethers.parseEther("0.01").
           * Example: expect(ownerBalanceAfter).to.be.closeTo(ownerBalanceBefore - burnAmount, ethers.parseEther("0.01"));

  File: `/home/resurx/blockchain-projects/skimpy-token/test/integration.test.js`

   * `it("should allow a user to delegate their voting power and vote")`:
       * The current expect(await skimpy.getVotes(addr2.address)).to.be.closeTo(transferAmount, ethers.parseEther("1")); is correct.
       * The line expect(proposalVotes.forVotes).to.equal(transferAmount); needs to be changed to expect(proposalVotes.forVotes).to.be.closeTo(transferAmount, 
         ethers.parseEther("1")); to account for decay.

  Task 2: Update Documentation

  File: `/home/resurx/blockchain-projects/skimpy-token/PROGRESS.md`

   * Update "Short Term" section:
       * Remove Advanced tokenomics (demurrage, decay) from the "Short Term" list, as it will be completed.
       * Add a new entry under "Completed Tasks" (e.g., under Phase 4) for "Demurrage (Token Decay) Implementation".

  File: `/home/resurx/blockchain-projects/skimpy-token/README.md`

   * Add a new section (e.g., after "Token Design Notes") explaining the Demurrage feature.
   * Content for the new section:

   1     ## Tokenomics: Demurrage (Token Decay)
   2 
   3     SKIMPY tokens are designed with a **demurrage** mechanism, meaning their balance slowly decreases over time. This feature is implemented to:
   4 
   5     *   **Discourage Hoarding:** Incentivize active use and circulation of tokens rather than holding them passively.
   6     *   **Stimulate Activity:** Encourage participation within the ecosystem by creating a cost for inaction.
   7     *   **Experimentation:** Serve as a practical experiment in dynamic tokenomics, aligning with the project's goal as a "public learning lab."
   8 
   9     The decay is applied "just-in-time" whenever a token balance is accessed (e.g., during transfers or when checking `balanceOf`). The current decay
     rate is set to approximately 20% annually.

  File: `/home/resurx/blockchain-projects/skimpy-token/docs/GOVERNANCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

   * Add a small note to the "How to Participate in Governance" section, or specifically in the "Delegating Your Voting Power" subsection, to mention that demurrage
     affects voting power over time, reinforcing the need for timely delegation and voting.
   * Content for the note (integrate naturally):

   1     **Note on Demurrage:** Due to the token's demurrage mechanism, your SKMP balance (and thus your voting power) will slowly decrease over time. It is
     important to delegate your votes and participate in governance in a timely manner to ensure your voting power is accurately reflected.

  Final Steps:

   1. After making all the code and documentation changes, please run the tests to confirm everything passes:
      npx hardhat test
   2. Provide the full, modified content of all changed files.

  Let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on any of these steps. I'm ready for your output."
